# Brew-Haven-Cafe
The pet project of web-site for a potential coffee shop

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to showcase the skills in working with HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. The case of my project is the website for a potential coffee shop called “Brew Haven Cafe”. This project implements a variety of methodologies and instruments in order to maintain a multiple page ecosystem. 
This project consists of 9 HTML pages, 1 CSS file with additional CSS code in each HTML file for unique adjustments, and 1 JS file with additional JS scripts in some HTML files.

## Methodology
The design for this project was created during the actual workflow. Throughout the development, multiple websites and activity resources were investigated and used, including the https://www.w3schools.com/. All the images and videos were found on the web, one of the most useful platforms for me was Pixabay.

## Composition
This project consists of the following pages:
1)	Home - main page, contains the navigation bar with links to all other tabs, as well as the name of the company on the top that refers to the index tab. The navigation bar is always fixed on the top on every page so it can be accessed even from the bottom of the page. The Home page also has some welcoming text.
2)	Index - advertising page with video on the background.
3)	About us - contains brief information about the company, the events that are held in the cafe. 
4)	Menu - the menu of the company, gives the table of content of the cafe. On the top part of the page is the banner with Order Button.
5)	Order - a form using the JS to calculate the final price after selecting the order and has a button to submit the order.
6)	Info - the tab that tells how the coffee in the company is made, where the bins are coming from.
7)	Contact Us - the table that shows the variety of contact forms available. Also, it includes the links to popular social media.
8)	Locations - gives a specific explanation about where the cafe is located and how to get to it. 
9)	Feedback - the feedback form implementing the possibility for customers to live some message to the managers of the company. Also uses some JS for validation of the form.
